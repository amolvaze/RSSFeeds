Brief Read Me Documentation – RSS Feeds

•	Project has two main files - Feed.html & Styles.css.

•	JavaScript code is embedded in same html file which uses code from Google Feed API

•	Link for Google Feed API:- https://developers.google.com/feed/?hl=en

•	Link for feeds under consideration :- http://feeds.feedburner.com/tedtalks_video

•	The goal of this project is to consume all feeds of above Ted URL entirely using Google Feed API & display the feed list on the web –page.

•	Also, this project is able to display feed either static or dynamically meaning that we can control number of feed entries to be displayed on the web page.

•	For this project, it has been coded to make it work in dynamic fashion. It will ask user how many feed entries that should be displayed every time when the page loads.

•	By default, it is displaying top 4 feeds from Ted URL.

•	Also, when page or window loads, a JavaScript function is called for displaying feed list on web page.

•	Once the list is displayed to the user, if user clicks on any one of the links, details for that particular link (feed entry) should be shown by redirecting user to that page.

•	Visited feed entries are indicated by the different colours on the web page.
